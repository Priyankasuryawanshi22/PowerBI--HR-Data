    - **Data Cleaning:** Started with preprocessing the HR CSV file to ensure data quality.
    - **Data Analysis:** Investigated the cleaned dataset to identify key factors influencing attrition rates.
    - **Visualization:** Created a comprehensive job satisfaction chart to correlate employee contentment with attrition.
    
    **Key Findings:**
    
    - Identified critical attributes affecting employee turnover, including departmental alignment, age groups, compensation levels, and years of service.
    - Visualized the data to highlight departments with the highest attrition rates, providing a clear direction for targeted retention strategies.
    
    **Technologies Used:**
    
    - **Power BI:** Leveraged for its robust data modeling and visualization capabilities.
    
    **Outcome:** The project successfully delivered actionable insights that can guide the company in implementing effective retention strategies and improving overall job satisfaction.
